# üëã Hey!

I'm alexa (also known as bqsi, AllowSleep or px(l) on other parts of the internet).
Please reach out professionally to learn my real name and address me as such!

I'm a computing enthusiast and actively learning software engineer based in the UK.
I spend most of my free time making new things or trying to learn about existing things.

I'm over on Discord as `allowsleep.`, but you can also email me at `allowsleep@emotes.co`!

If you're trying to reach me elsewhere, please correspond via email so I can know that you're going to be getting in touch. I rarely read unexpected messages.

## ‚òÑÔ∏è I'm currently...

- üï∫ @ [Emotes CO](https://emotes.co) as Co-Owner and Lead of Operations

- ‚òï @ [cofi](https://www.roblox.com/groups/5237002/cofi) as a Brand Runner & Co-Founder

- Working on branching my skills from game development to also web development and application development - these areas excite my creativity the most!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Skills & Tools

I can work in the following programming languages to their respective degrees of difficulty:

- <img height=18px src="https://luau-lang.org/assets/images/luau-88.png"> <b>Lua</b> & <img height=18px src="https://www.lua.org/favicon.ico"> <b>Luau</b>, which I've been working with since 2019 as part of my work on Roblox.

   I'm fairly proficient and fluent in these languages. They're easily my favourite to work in.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://www.python.org/favicon.ico"> <b>Python</b>, which I occasionally used for personal projects over the course of 3 years.

   I'm fairly independent in this language. It's pretty fun to make stuff in.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg"> <b>JavaScript</b>, which I occasionally used for personal projects over the course of 1 year.

   I'm still learning this language whenever I can, but am not independent with it yet.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/C_Sharp_wordmark.svg/1920px-C_Sharp_wordmark.svg.png"> <b>C#</b>, which I occasionally used for personal projects over the course of 3 months.

   I'm still learning this language whenever I can, but am not independent with it yet. I love the idea of adopting it for other areas of development.

I use <b>Visual Studio Code</b> and <b>Roblox Studio</b> to edit and shape my code.

I'm very keen on expanding my knowledge of languages later down the line and hope to develop my skills as I do so.
