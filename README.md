# üëã Hey!

I'm alexa (also known as bqsi, AllowSleep or px(l) on other parts of the internet).
Please reach out professionally to learn my real name and address me as such!

I'm a computing enthusiast and actively learning software engineer based in the UK.
I spend most of my free time making new things or trying to learn about existing things.

I'm over @ Discord as `alexa#0001`, or you can email me @ `px@omg.lol` or `allowsleep@emotescorp.co` if needed!

A few more socials can be seen over @ my [landing page](https://px.omg.lol) if you wanna get in contact informally.

If you're trying to reach me elsewhere, please correspond via email so I can know that you're going to be getting in touch. I rarely read unexpected messages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Skills & Tools

I can work in the following programming languages to their respective degrees of difficulty:

- <img height=18px src="https://luau-lang.org/assets/images/luau-88.png"> <b>Lua</b> & <img height=18px src="https://www.lua.org/favicon.ico"> <b>Luau</b>, which I've been working with for around 3 years as part of my work on Roblox.

   I'm fairly proficient and fluent in these languages. They're easily my favourite to work in.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://www.python.org/favicon.ico"> <b>Python</b>, which I've been working on-and-off with for around 2 years now as part of my educational work and also for some personal projects of mine.

   I'm fairly independent in this language. It's pretty fun to make stuff in.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg"> <b>JavaScript</b>, which I've been working with for around a year now as part of some personal projects.

   I'm still learning this language whenever I can, but am not independent with it yet. I'm fascinated by its syntax and mannerisms.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/C_Sharp_wordmark.svg/1920px-C_Sharp_wordmark.svg.png"> <b>C#</b>, which I've been working with for around a month collectively as part of some personal projects and also in an effort to teach myself the language.

   I'm still learning this language whenever I can, but am not independent with it yet. I'm a huge fan of the potential of working in this language.

I mainly use <b>Roblox Studio</b> in my work to edit and shape code.
I'm well-versed in using <b>Visual Studio Code</b> and <b>Notepad++</b> to do the same.

I'm very keen on expanding my knowledge of languages later down the line and hope to develop my skills as I do so.
