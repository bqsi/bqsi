## ‚öôÔ∏è Skills & Tools

I can work in the following programming languages to their respective degrees of difficulty:

- <img height=18px src="https://luau-lang.org/assets/images/luau-88.png"> <img height=18px src="https://www.lua.org/favicon.ico"> I've been working with <b>Lua and Luau</b> for around 3 years as part of my work on Roblox.

   I'm fairly proficient and fluent in these languages.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://www.python.org/favicon.ico"> I've been working with <b>Python</b> on-and-off for around 2 years now as part of my educational work and also for some personal projects of mine.

   I'm fairly independent in this language.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Unofficial_JavaScript_logo_2.svg"> I've been working rarely with <b>JavaScript</b> for around a year now as part of some personal projects.

   I'm still learning this language whenever I can, but am not independent with it yet.
   
- <img height=18px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/C_Sharp_wordmark.svg/1920px-C_Sharp_wordmark.svg.png"> I've been working very rarely with <b>C#</b> for around a month collectively as part of some personal projects and also in an effort to teach myself the language.

   I'm still learning this language whenever I can, but am not independent with it yet.

I mainly use <b>Roblox Studio</b> in my work to edit and shape code.
I'm well-versed in using <b>Visual Studio Code</b> to do the same.
